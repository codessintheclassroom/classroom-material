## Step 6: Further learning

We hope that at least some of the material you've covered with us today has
been new to you. We hope that we might even have inspired you to learn more.
We have a few suggestions for things to read more about.

### Conceptual

- If you're interested in learning more about React, the React Docs include
  an excellent [tutorial guide to the main
  concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).
- If you want to know more about limitations of, and possible alternatives
  to, SPAs, [this article and
  video](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/beyond-spa) from
  Google explains a number of alternative architectures for frontend
  applications.
- If you're interested in some of the performance and user experience issues
  that can arise with JavaScript-heavy frontend applications, be sure to
  check out [Addy Osmani on "The Cost Of
  JavaScript"](https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e).
- If you didn't already, read [Sean Hammond's article on effective code
  review](https://seanh.cc/post/code-review/) and maybe share it with your
  team at work.

### Practical

- Learn about the differences between [React class components and function
  components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components),
  and convert `PetCard` into a function component.
- Add an inquiry form (as described at the end of
[`03-connecting-the-api.md`](https://github.com/codessintheclassroom/classroom-material/blob/master/workshop1/03-connecting-the-api.md).
- Learn [how to use Chrome's Devtools to debug React performance
issues](https://calibreapp.com/blog/react-performance-profiling-optimization/).

_**Don't forget** that you can join the mentors/helpers from the workshop in
our Teams community channel to talk about any and all of the above. Unless
you opted out, you'll be invited to this directly within a few days of the
workshop._
