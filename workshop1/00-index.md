# Workshop 1: Modern front-end web development

Welcome! In this workshop you're going to learn about building single-page
web applications (SPAs) by building one for an animal shelter.

This file gives you an overview of what you'll cover in the workshop. Feel
free to browse, but note that each step builds on work done in the previous
steps, so you'll want to stick to the order below when building your own
animal shelter application.

## Learning goals

In this workshop, we're aiming to help you learn about the following:

- What is a single-page application (SPA)?
- What is an API (application programming interface)?
- How to talk to an API from a SPA built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- How to use GitHub to submit a pull request (PR).
- How to use pull requests as part of a code review process.

## Workshop guide

Here are the guides for each step of the workshop. Start at the beginning and
work your way through. Don't forget: if you're not sure about anything or
have any questions, just ask any of the friendly mentors!
