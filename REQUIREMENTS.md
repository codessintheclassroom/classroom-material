# Course prerequisites

_**TL;DR:** here's a [checklist for workshop 1](#workshop-1-checklist)!_

If you're planning on attending the _Codess in the Classroom_ workshops, we'd
like to request that you have a few things set up before you arrive. This
will help make the workshop run smoothly, and will give us more time to talk
about interesting topics!

## For all workshops

Please make sure that you have:

1. a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and

2. a [free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

Both of these accounts will be free to set up. We will also expect you to
have the following development tools installed:

3. A programmers' text editor such as [Visual Studio
   Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   If you are familiar with another editor, feel free to use it! If you do
   so, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to help you with it during the
   workshop (but we'll do our best!).

4. The [Git](https://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system
   software.

   We recommend you use the [official installation
   package](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you're not familiar with Git
   already, we'd also suggest you get comfortable with the basics. Our [Git
   cheatsheet](https://github.com/codessintheclassroom/classroom-material/blob/master/git-cheatsheet.md) can help with this.

## For workshop 1

For workshop 1 it will be helpful if you have some familiarity with
JavaScript, because we'll be developing a simple web front-end.

Please also ensure that you have installed the latest LTS ("long-term
support") version of Node.js from [the Node.js homepage](https://nodejs.org/).

You can test if everything is set up correctly by opening a shell (PowerShell
or `cmd.exe` on Windows) and running the following:

    C:\...> git version
    git version 2.21.0.windows.1
    C:\...> node -v
    v10.15.3
    C:\...> npx -v
    6.4.1

You should see similar output, although the exact version numbers don't
matter. If you encounter errors, note that you will need to seek us out at
the workshop to resolve these issues.

### Workshop 1 checklist
